This game is developed with Python (pyGame). 
Tha game has 4 levels, and in each level he number of butterflies goes up,
and size of the zone of contact on the net, goes smaller. 
Each butterfly has its own direction and its own speed.
The player has a time limit in wich he has to catch all the butterflies,
if not all the butterflies already cought are going to be release. This process 
happens only 2 times in a level of the game.
